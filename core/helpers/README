/core/helpers

Place UDF scripts here.

In a multi-application install, shared scripts should be placed in
/core/helpers, and application-specific scripts place inside /application/helpers.

In a single-application install (one "application" directory), it is OK
to put all scripts in /application/helpers and leave /core/helpers alone.

You should never touch files under the core/base directory.
