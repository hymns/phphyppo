/core/libraries

Place library here.

In a multi-application install, shared library should be placed in
/core/libraries, and application-specific library place inside /application/libraries.

In a single-application install (one "application" directory), it is OK
to put all library in /application/libraries and leave /core/libraries alone.

You should never touch files under the core/base directory.
