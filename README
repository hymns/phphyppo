DESCRIPTION:

    What is phpHyppo Framework?

    phpHyppo is an Model-View-Controller application framework for PHP.
    Its design target to minimally provide separation between the database
    operations (Model), the presentation (View), and the logic in between
    (Controller). With very little extras bundled in, this framework is
    probaly fast and flexible. Some design aspects and terminology of phpHyppo
    have been inspired by other famous PHP frameworks, although the core code
    is 100% original.

    What phpHyppo is NOT

    phpHyppo is NOT a full-featured framework. As it stands, it is a simple
    MVC structure with a database support layer (PDO). Any and all features
    you require such as form validation or social library are easily added
    with your own library. Library will become available in the guide as
    they are programmed or contributed by other users. If a library is
    essential enough, it may eventually find its way to the next core release.


REQUIREMENTS:

    phpHyppo requires PHP 5.1+. The bundled database active record plugin 
    library requires PDO, which is included with PHP 5.1 and above.


FEATURES:

    phpHyppo supplies easy separation between Model, View and Controller
    and supports PDO for the database abstraction layer. Each and every
    component of phpHyppo is customizable with class extensions, and the
    framework is easily extended with your own library.

    Multiple applications are also easy to setup. You can drop your library
    at the application level, or you can share them across applications.
    The file structure is setup so your customizations are kept isolated from
    the core, so updates are easy to maintain.
