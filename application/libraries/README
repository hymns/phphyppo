/application/libraries

Place library class here.

In a single-application install (one "application" directory), it is OK
to put all libraries in /application/libraries and leave /shared/libraries alone.

In a multi-application install, shared libraries should be placed in
/shared/libraries, and application-specific library go in /application/libraries.

You should never touch files under the core directory.
