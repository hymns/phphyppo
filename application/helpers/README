/application/helpers

Place UDF scripts here.

In a single-application install (one "application" directory), it is OK
to put all scripts in /application/helpers and leave /shared/helpers alone.

In a multi-application install, shared scripts should be placed in
/shared/helpers, and application-specific plugins go in /application/helpers.

You should never touch files under the core directory.
